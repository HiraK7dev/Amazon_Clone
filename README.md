# Amazon Clone

This project is an Amazon clone that replicates the design of the famous e-commerce platform, Amazon. It serves as a hands-on learning experience in web development, focusing on key concepts such as the Box Model in CSS and the effective use of Display Properties and Flexbox.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the web pages is built using HTML, ensuring a clear and organized layout.

- **CSS:** The styling of the project is accomplished with CSS, implementing the Box Model for precise control over element dimensions and spacing.

- **Flexbox:** The Flexbox layout model is employed to create flexible and responsive designs, particularly useful for structuring components such as the navigation bar and product listings.

## Learning Highlights

While working on this project, several key concepts were mastered:

### 1. Box Model in CSS

Understanding the Box Model is fundamental to creating well-designed and visually appealing websites. It involves comprehending the properties related to the content, padding, border, and margin of an HTML element. Manipulating these properties allows for precise control over the layout and spacing of elements on the page.

### 2. Display Properties

The use of various display properties, such as `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, and `flex`, plays a crucial role in determining how elements are positioned and interact with each other. This project explores the versatility of display properties to achieve the desired structure and layout.

### 3. Flexbox

Flexbox is a powerful layout model that simplifies the design of complex user interfaces. It enables the creation of flexible and responsive layouts with a more efficient and predictable structure. The project leverages Flexbox to enhance the responsiveness and alignment of elements within the Amazon clone.
